ðŸ“Š Change Over Time Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - Analyze monthly sales trends using different date functions:
        â€¢ YEAR(), MONTH()
        â€¢ DATETRUNC()
        â€¢ FORMAT()
    - Compare total sales, customer count, and quantity sold over time.
    - Track how many new customers were acquired each year.

Queries Included:
    1. Sales performance by year and month using YEAR(), MONTH()
    2. Monthly aggregation using DATETRUNC() for accurate time grouping
    3. Readable date formatting with FORMAT() for reporting
    4. Annual new customer acquisition from customer dimension table

Tables Used:
    - gold.fact_sales
    - gold.dim_customers
